# Titanic Survival Predictions

## Overview
This system is designed to predict the likelihood of a person's survival in the event of a sinking. It takes into account various factors that historically have influenced survival rates, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and predict outcomes.
- **Factor Analysis**: Determines which factors most significantly affect the chances of survival.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to input personal details and receive a survival likelihood assessment.

## Data
The system is trained on historical datasets, such as the Titanic passenger manifest, which includes the following features:
- **Socio-Economic Status**: Classified as upper, middle, or lower class.
- **Age**: Numerical value representing the person's age.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Additional Factors**: Cabin location, ticket fare, number of accompanying relatives, etc.

## Model
The core of the system is a machine learning model that has been trained and tested on historical data. The model's performance has been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics to ensure reliability.

## Installation
Instructions on setting up the system locally, including environment setup, dependency installation, and steps to run the application.

## Usage
How to use the system, including how to input data and interpret the system's predictions.
