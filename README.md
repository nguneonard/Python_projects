# PYTHON PROJECTS

This repository contains my python projects. Here are the different projects and their descriptions.

1. [Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office](#Netflix-Movies)

This project is part of the DataCamp course on "Data Manipulation with Python" and aims to provide a practical experience in manipulating and analyzing data using Python and the pandas library. Specifically, this project involves investigating the relationship between the duration of Netflix movies and the year of their release.

4. [A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners](#Nobel-Prize-Winners)

Step into the world of Nobel Prize winners with this captivating project. Explore a century's worth of data and discover who won, who got snubbed, and what characteristics the winners share. Uncover the truth about biases, which countries dominate, and who managed to win it twice. Join the journey of unraveling the mysteries of the most prestigious scientific award in the world. check out the project here: <a href="https://github.com/nguneonard/Python_projects/tree/main/History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners">Nobel Prize Winners</a>

5. [ Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing](#Discovery-of-Handwashing)

The "Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing" project explores Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis' groundbreaking discovery in the 19th century. By analyzing historical data, we uncover the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates in hospitals. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and statistical analysis techniques, we compare mortality rates, validate Dr. Semmelweis' findings, and emphasize the significance of proper hand hygiene. Contributions are welcome, and running the provided Jupyter Notebook will reveal the transformative power of handwashing in medicine.

6. [Predicting Credit Card Approvals](#Credit_card_approval)

Welcome to the Premium Project: Predicting Credit Card Approvals! Build a machine learning model to predict credit card application approval. Commercial banks receive numerous applications that often get rejected due to various reasons, making manual analysis time-consuming and error-prone. In this project, leverage machine learning techniques to automate the process and create an accurate credit card approval predictor.

7. [Climate Change and Impacts in Africa](#climate_change)

Welcome to the "Climate Change and Impacts in Africa" project! In this project, you'll have the opportunity to make a significant contribution to understanding and addressing the critical issue of climate change in the African continent. As a member of a non-governmental organization (NGO), your task is to report on the state of climate change in Africa at the upcoming African Union Summit. You will achieve this by cleaning, combining, and analyzing the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset to create a comprehensive report. Additionally, you'll provide insights into the impact of climate change on specific African regions using four countries as case studies.
