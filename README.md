# PYTHON PROJECTS

This repository contains my python projects. Here are the different projects and their descriptions.

1. [Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office](#Netflix-Movies)

This project is part of the DataCamp course on "Data Manipulation with Python" and aims to provide a practical experience in manipulating and analyzing data using Python and the pandas library. Specifically, this project involves investigating the relationship between the duration of Netflix movies and the year of their release. The detail notebook is found here: <a href="https://github.com/nguneonard/Python_projects/tree/main/NETFLIX">Netflix Movies and Guest Stars</a>
