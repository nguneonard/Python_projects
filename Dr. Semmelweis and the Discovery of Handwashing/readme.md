This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

# Project Description
In this project, we will explore the historical data from Dr. Semmelweis' work and analyze the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates. By applying statistical techniques, we will gain insights into the significance of his findings and understand how his discovery revolutionized the field of medicine.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two files:

yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv: This file contains the annual number of births and deaths from puerperal fever in two clinics - Clinic 1 and Clinic 2 - from the years 1841 to 1849.

monthly_deaths.csv: This file contains the monthly number of births and deaths from puerperal fever at the Vienna General Hospital's maternity clinic from the years 1821 to 1830.

# Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Analyze historical data to understand the high mortality rates from puerperal fever.
- Compare the mortality rates between doctors and midwives in the maternity wards.
- Explore the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates.
- Apply statistical techniques to validate Dr. Semmelweis' findings.
- Visualize the data and present the results effectively.

# Technologies Used
The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Statistical analysis techniques
