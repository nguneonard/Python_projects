This project explores a dataset from Kaggle containing over a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. The Nobel Prize is an esteemed scientific award given annually to scholars and scientists in different fields such as chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace.

The dataset used in this project  provides an opportunity to explore the characteristics of Nobel Prize winners over the years. Through this project, we'll try to answer some interesting questions such as which countries have produced the most Nobel laureates, the gender distribution of winners, age differences among prize categories, the youngest and oldest winners, repeat laureates, and more.

## Project Tasks
1. The most Nobel of Prizes: In this task, we'll begin by exploring the Nobel Prize dataset and getting familiar with its contents.

2. So, who gets the Nobel Prize?: In this task, we'll delve into the dataset to determine the characteristics of Nobel laureates. Who are they? What do they do? What kind of work do they produce?

3. USA dominance: This task explores the dominance of the United States in the Nobel Prize. We'll investigate the reasons why the USA has produced so many Nobel laureates over the years.

4. USA dominance, visualized: In this task, we'll visualize the data from task 3 to gain a better understanding of the USA's dominance in the Nobel Prize.

5. What is the gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner?: This task investigates the gender distribution of Nobel laureates. We'll analyze the proportion of male and female winners and compare them across different prize categories.

6. The first woman to win the Nobel Prize: In this task, we'll focus on the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and explore the challenges faced by women in science.

7. Repeat laureates: In this task, we'll look at the Nobel Prize winners who have received the award more than once. Who are they? What have they accomplished?

8. How old are you when you get the prize?: This task explores the age differences among Nobel laureates. We'll analyze the average age at which winners receive the prize and compare it across different prize categories.

9. Age differences between prize categories: In this task, we'll compare the age at which winners receive the prize across different categories.

10. Oldest and youngest winners: This task investigates the age distribution of Nobel laureates, and we'll identify the oldest and youngest winners in each category.

11. You get a prize!: In this final task, we'll create a function that takes in a year and returns the Nobel Prize winner for that year.
