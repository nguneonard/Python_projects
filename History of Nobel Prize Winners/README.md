Welcome to our project, where we explore a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed? Let's find out together!


## Project Description
The Nobel Prize is a prestigious award given to scientists and scholars for their outstanding contributions to chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was awarded in 1901, and since then, it has become one of the most recognized and coveted awards in the world.

The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle, which contains a comprehensive list of all the Nobel Laureates from 1901 to the present. We will analyze this data to uncover insights about the characteristics of the prize winners, which country receives the most awards, and if anyone has ever won the prize twice. 
The dataset of the project is found here: <a href="https://github.com/nguneonard/Python_projects/blob/main/History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners/A%20Visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners/datasets/nobel.csv ">Noble_price_winners </a> 

Using Python, we will build a project that provides a specific solution to this problem, with guided tasks and real-time automated code checks. Our goal is to create a captivating visualization of the data that makes it easy to understand and draws people into the fascinating history of the Nobel Prize.

## How to Get Started
To get started, you will need to install Python on your machine. We recommend using the latest version of Python 3, which you can download from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open the project files in your preferred code editor. From there, you can run the Python scripts and view the results in your web browser.

## Project Tasks
1. The most Nobel of Prizes: 

In this task, we'll begin by exploring the Nobel Prize dataset and getting familiar with its contents.

2. So, who gets the Nobel Prize?: 

In this task, we'll delve into the dataset to determine the characteristics of Nobel laureates. Who are they? What do they do? What kind of work do they produce?

3. USA dominance:

This task explores the dominance of the United States in the Nobel Prize. We'll investigate the reasons why the USA has produced so many Nobel laureates over the years.

4. USA dominance, visualized: 

In this task, we'll visualize the data from task 3 to gain a better understanding of the USA's dominance in the Nobel Prize.

5. What is the gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner?:

This task investigates the gender distribution of Nobel laureates. We'll analyze the proportion of male and female winners and compare them across different prize categories.

6. The first woman to win the Nobel Prize: 

In this task, we'll focus on the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and explore the challenges faced by women in science.

7. Repeat laureates: 

In this task, we'll look at the Nobel Prize winners who have received the award more than once. Who are they? What have they accomplished?

8. How old are you when you get the prize?: 

This task explores the age differences among Nobel laureates. We'll analyze the average age at which winners receive the prize and compare it across different prize categories.

9. Age differences between prize categories: 

In this task, we'll compare the age at which winners receive the prize across different categories.

10. Oldest and youngest winners: 

This task investigates the age distribution of Nobel laureates, and we'll identify the oldest and youngest winners in each category.

11. You get a prize!: 

In this final task, we'll create a function that takes in a year and returns the Nobel Prize winner for that year.

## Tools and Technologies
This project will be implemented using Python. We'll be using various libraries such as 
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib, and 
- Seaborn 
- pandas 
- numpy
- Jupyter notebook

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving the project. If you find any bugs or issues, please submit a pull request or open an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Conclusion
We hope this project inspires you to learn more about the Nobel Prize and the amazing individuals who have received it over the past century. With our project, you can explore the data in a visual and interactive way, uncover insights, and draw your own conclusions about the Nobel Laureates. Thank you for joining us on this journey!
