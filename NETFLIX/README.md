Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining.

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the data to gain insights into the trends and patterns in the Netflix movie industry and the guest stars in The Office.

we analyze the data on the duration of Netflix movies from 2011 to 2020. We create a dictionary and a DataFrame using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. We then use these data structures to create visualizations such as line plots and scatter plots to gain insights into the trends in the Netflix movie industry.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and visualizations for the project.: <a href="https://github.com/nguneonard/Python_projects/blob/main/NETFLIX/notebook.py">Netflix Movies and Guest Stars code </a>

CSV file containing the data on Netflix movies: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayank1101sharma/netflix-datasets?select=netflix_data.csv">Netflix Movies and Guest Stars</a>


## Results
Through the analysis and visualizations, we gain insights into the trends and patterns in the Netflix movie industry and the guest stars in The Office. We discover that the movie duration has been relatively stable over the years, with some fluctuations but no clear trend towards shorter or longer movies.
