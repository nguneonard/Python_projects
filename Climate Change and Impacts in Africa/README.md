According to the <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/external-link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fen%2Fclimatechange%2Fwhat-is-climate-change">United Nations</a>, Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sunâ€™s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms, and declining biodiversity.

You work for a Non-governmental organization tasked with reporting the state of climate change in Africa at the upcoming African Union Summit. The head of analytics has provided you with <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/external-link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1cNhVUPKYP79AayGJp89_tXCJmHoxQO4cwiaseSziwbY%2Fedit%23gid%3D191680117">IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset</a>
which you will clean, combine and analyze to create a report on the state of climate change in Africa. You will also provide insights on the impact of climate change on African regions (with four countries, one from each African region, as case studies).

 1. Project Overview:
    
Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues, and Africa is particularly vulnerable to its impacts. This project aims to harness data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights into the current state of CO2 emissions in African regions and understand how climate change is affecting them.

2. Dataset: 

The IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset is a critical component of this project. It contains valuable information about CO2 emissions by country and industry between 1970 and 2021. This dataset is derived from the EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) Community GHG database version 7.0 (2022), and it is based on data from IEA (2021) Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy.

### Dataset Structure:

TOTALS BY COUNTRY SHEET: Contains annual CO2 emissions (in kilotons) produced between 1970 - 2021 in each country.

### Relevant Columns:

- C_group_IM24_sh: The region of the world.
- Country_code_A3: The country code.
- Name: The name of the country.
- Y_1970 - Y_2021: The amount of CO2 emissions (kilotons) from 1970 - 2021.
- IPCC 2006 Sheets: Contains CO2 emissions by country and the industry responsible.

### Relevant Columns:

- C_group_IM24_sh: The region of the world.
- Country_code_A3: The country code.
- Name: The name of the country.
- Y_1970 - Y_2021: The amount of CO2 emissions (kilotons) from 1970 - 2021.
- ipcc_code_2006_for_standard_report_name: The industry responsible for generating CO2.

3. Instructions:
   
Your mission is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the IEA-EDGAR CO2 dataset to generate insights and reports for the upcoming African Union Summit. Here are the key tasks:

- Clean and Tidy the Datasets: Prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing any missing or inconsistent data.

- Create a Line Plot: Visualize the trend of CO2 levels across African regions.

- Analyze Time and CO2 Levels: Determine the relationship between time (Year) and CO2 levels across African regions.

- Compare CO2 Levels: Determine if there is a significant difference in CO2 levels among African regions.

- Identify Common Industries: Find the top 5 industries in each African region based on CO2 emissions.

- Industry Impact: Determine the industry responsible for the most CO2 emissions (on average) in each African region.

- Predict CO2 Levels: Predict CO2 levels in the year 2025 for each African region.

- Temperature Analysis: Explore the impact of CO2 levels on annual temperatures in selected African countries.
