Welcome to the Predicting Credit Card Approvals project! In this project, you will have the opportunity to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. This task is of great importance to commercial banks as it helps automate the approval process, saving time and reducing errors.

## Project Description
Commercial banks deal with a large number of credit card applications on a daily basis. However, manually evaluating each application is a tedious and error-prone task. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques are employed to automate the process, which is now commonly adopted by commercial banks.

In this project, you will have the opportunity to build your own automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging the power of data and predictive models, you can mimic the approach employed by real banks. This project will utilize the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, providing you with a realistic scenario to work on.

## Project Tasks
The project consists of 12 tasks that will guide you through the entire process of building and evaluating your credit card approval predictor. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

1. Credit card applications: Gain an understanding of the dataset and its attributes, which represent credit card applications.
2. Inspecting the applications: Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, distributions, and potential issues in the dataset.
3. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets: Divide the dataset into two subsets: one for training the model and another for evaluating its performance.
4. Handling the missing values (part i): Address missing values in the dataset by identifying them and applying appropriate strategies.
5. Handling the missing values (part ii): Continue handling missing values by using different techniques to impute or remove incomplete data.
6. Handling the missing values (part iii): Further refine the handling of missing values to ensure the dataset is ready for model training.
7. Preprocessing the data (part i): Prepare the dataset by performing various preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
8. Preprocessing the data (part ii): Continue preprocessing the data by applying additional transformations and feature engineering techniques.
9. Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set: Train a logistic regression model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance.
10. Making predictions and evaluating performance: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on the test set and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
11. Grid searching and making the model perform better: Improve the model's performance by fine-tuning its hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation.
12. Finding the best performing model: Compare the performance of different models and select the best performing one as your final credit card approval predictor.
