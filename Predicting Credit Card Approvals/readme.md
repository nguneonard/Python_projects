Welcome to the Predicting Credit Card Approvals project! In this project, you will have the opportunity to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. This task is of great importance to commercial banks as it helps automate the approval process, saving time and reducing errors.

## Project Description
Commercial banks deal with a large number of credit card applications on a daily basis. However, manually evaluating each application is a tedious and error-prone task. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques are employed to automate the process, which is now commonly adopted by commercial banks.

In this project, you will have the opportunity to build your own automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging the power of data and predictive models, you can mimic the approach employed by real banks. This project will utilize the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, providing you with a realistic scenario to work on.
